\"Beth Or\" is literally translated as \"House of Light\". It was the intention of the architect, the stained glass artist, and the building committee to maintain the theme of \"light\" in the Gitlin Sanctuary.

The bronze words over the ark, taken from Psalms 97:11, exemplify this intention in Hebrew:

אור זרע לצדיק ולישרי לב שמחה
_OR ZARU’AH LATZADIK UL’YISHREI LEV SIMCHAH_
\"Light is sown for the righteous and gladness for the upright in heart.\"

The \"Ner Tamid\" or \"Eternal Light\" glowing over the ark continues the theme of \"light\" in the sanctuary. Note the solid quartz crystal in the center.

To the left of the ark (from the viewpoint of the congregation) is the seven branched bronze menorah,  also a symbol of light and the recognized symbol of all of Zion and Israel.

To the right of the ark (from the viewpoint of the congregation) on the wall in the choir loft, is a magnificent tapestry that spells out \"לדור ודור,\" (_L'DOR VA'DOR_) meaning \"From generation to generation.\" This tapestry reminds us of the tagline of our congregation: \"Lighting the path for all generations.\"

You will also see that every window with the exception of the HOLOCAUST window has the same shade of blue in the background. This is important as the artist wished to emphasize the permanence of the generations of Israel. The representative color which is blue, continues throughout all generations and therefore is shown in all of the windows.

    static let artistAbout = """
Born in Belgium, Gilsoul served his apprenticeship in the art of stained glass production and execution and worked in many churches and related projects in Europe. He is a 1938 graduate of the Academie des Beau Arts, the top Belgian art college. He came to this country in the early 1960s and has since executed many outstanding stained glass projects in churches, synagogues, residences, and public buildings. We were most fortunate to have this world famous artist execute our stained glass in the sanctuary, not only for his technical perfection but for the truly moving spirituality exemplified by the work that you see.

Mr. Gilsoul asked that the following statement be published, specifying his thanks:
"""
    static let artistQuote = """
"I would like to thank the architect, Wolfgang Rapp, who created Beth Or's new Sanctuary. I also thank the Rabbi, and the members of the building committee, particularly Dr. Jay Rosan and Dr. Bruce Sklar for the confidence they showed in allowing me to realize the stained glass windows for the temple.

I thank particularly Bill for his knowledge, advice, and asistance - his patience was precious to me.

I am grateful to all the people I met during the realization of this project, and I wish also to thank Helmut Shardt and Larry Gordon for their collaboration in executing the windows.

It is my hype that these windows, and that this ark, show the unique spiritual vocation of Israel among the civilizations of the world, and its ever renewed youth and vitality.

Again, Thank you all."
