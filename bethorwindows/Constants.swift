Beth Or is literally translated as House of Light. It was the intention of the architect, the stained glass artist and the building committee to maintain the theme of \"light\" in the Gitlin Sanctuary.

The bronze words over the ark exemplify this intention. In Hebrew, \"OR –ZAH-ROO- AH LAH-TSAH-DEEK, OO-L'YISRAY-LAVE SIMCHAH\" means \"Light is sown for the righteous and gladness for the upright in heart.\"

The \"Ner Tamid\" or \"Eternal Light\" glowing over the ark continues the theme of \"light\" in the sanctuary. Note the solid quartz crystal in the center.

To the right of the ark is the seven branched bronze menorah, also a symbol of light and the recognized symbol of all of Zion and Israel.

To the left of the ark on the wall behind the choir is a magnificent tapestry that spells out \"SHIR HASHIRIM\" – or \"Song of Songs\" embossed upon a shofar. The book \"Song of Songs\" has great beauty and many scholars feel that it is a collection of songs of love.

Born in Belgium, Gilsoul served his apprenticeship in the art of stained glass production and execution and worked in many churches and related projects in Europe. He is a 1938 graduate of the Academie des Beau Arts, the top Belgian art college. He came to this country in the early 1960s and has since executed many outstanding stained glass projects in churches, synagogues, residences and public buildings. We were most fortunate to have this world famous artist execute our stained glass in the sanctuary, not only for his technical perfection but for the truly moving spirituality exemplified by the work that you see. He died in 2000.
