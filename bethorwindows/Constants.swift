Born in Belgium, Gilsoul served his apprenticeship in the art of stained glass production and execution and worked in many churches and related projects in Europe. He is a 1938 graduate of the Academie des Beau Arts, the top Belgian art college. He came to this country in the early 1960s and has since executed many outstanding stained glass projects in churches, synagogues, residences, and public buildings. We were most fortunate to have this world famous artist execute our stained glass in the sanctuary, not only for his technical perfection but for the truly moving spirituality exemplified by the work that you see.

Mr. Gilsoul asked that the following statement be published, specifying his thanks:
"""
    static let artistQuote = """
"I would like to thank the architect, Wolfgang Rapp, who created Beth Or's new Sanctuary. I also thank the Rabbi, and the members of the building committee, particularly Dr. Jay Rosan and Dr. Bruce Sklar for the confidence they showed in allowing me to realize the stained glass windows for the temple.

I thank particularly Bill for his knowledge, advice, and asistance - his patience was precious to me.

I am grateful to all the people I met during the realization of this project, and I wish also to thank Helmut Shardt and Larry Gordon for their collaboration in executing the windows.

It is my hype that these windows, and that this ark, show the unique spiritual vocation of Israel among the civilizations of the world, and its ever renewed youth and vitality.

Again, Thank you all."
